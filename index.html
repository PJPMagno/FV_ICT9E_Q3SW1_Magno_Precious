							<td> Sandra Bullock as Malorie, Julian Edwards as Tom, Vivien Lyra Blair as Girl</td>
							<td><b>Anonymous:</b><i class="text-light"> "Decent watch, might watch again, and can recommend, at least as a one-off.
								I have technical frustrations with this movie, but it's premise alone is interesting enough that anyone interested in survival style movies should watch it, though I'm not sure how many people are re-watching this."</i> </td>

							<td>FRACTURED: When his wife and injured daughter disappeared from the emergency room, a man grows increasingly suspicious that the hospital is withholding crucial information.</td>
							<td>Sam Worthington as Ray Monroe, Lily Rabe as Joanne Monroe, Lucy Capri as Peri Monroe</td>
							<td><b>Anonymous:</b><i class="text-light"> "Watch it, its a good thriller that you'll think about for a few days(No Spoilers)
								Starts off strong and interesting, messes with your mind pretty hard just before the halfway points, and that's really the beauty, you start to look for clues early on and it results in what I thought was an unpredictable ending. This movie toys with you until quite literally the last minute. One minute you think one thing, the next you think the other"</i></td>
